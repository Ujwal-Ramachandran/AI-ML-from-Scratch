    "# **Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a Neural Network is a mathematical function that maps an input to an output. However, unlike a simple linear regression equation (y = mx + c), a neural network is composed of layers of interconnected \"neurons\" that can approximate incredibly complex, non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Biological Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is loosely inspired by the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Biological Neuron:** Receives electrical signals through dendrites. If the signal is strong enough, it \"fires\" (activates) and sends the signal down the axon to other neurons.\n",
    "   * **Artificial Neuron:** Receives numerical inputs. It multiplies them by specific \"weights\" (importance), adds a \"bias\" (threshold), and passes the result through an \"activation function\" (decision rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard Neural Network consists of three types of layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Input Layer:** The raw data enters here (e.g., pixels of an image, words in a sentence). No computation happens here; it's just a doorway.\n",
    "   2. **Hidden Layers:** The \"magic\" happens here. These layers transform the input data into abstract features. Deep Learning simply refers to networks with many hidden layers.\n",
    "   3. **Output Layer:** The final decision (e.g., \"Cat\" vs. \"Dog\", or a stock price prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It \"Learns\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is initially dumb. It starts with random weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Forward Pass (Guessing):** Data flows through the network. It makes a guess.\n",
    "   2. **Loss Calculation (Grading):** We compare the guess to the actual answer. The difference is the \"Loss\" or error.\n",
    "   3. **Backward Pass (Learning):** We use calculus (Chain Rule) to calculate which weights contributed most to the error.\n",
    "   4. **Optimization (Correction):** We adjust the weights slightly in the opposite direction of the error to reduce it next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Imagine trying to tune a radio to a specific clear station (the optimal function). You turn the knobs (weights) randomly at first. You hear static (high loss). You turn one knob slightly; the static gets worse. You turn it the other way; the static gets better. You keep doing this for all knobs until the signal is clear.\n",

    "The fundamental building block of a neural network is the Linear Layer (also called the Dense or Fully Connected layer). It performs a linear transformation on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanics & Math\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single layer, the mathematical operation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = W \\cdot A + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $A$: The input to this layer (or the output of the previous layer).\n",
    "   * $W$: The Weight matrix (the \"knobs\" we tune).\n",
    "   * $b$: The Bias vector (shifts the activation up or down).\n",
    "   * $Z$: The linear output (pre-activation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions (The Most Important Part)**\n",
    "To make the matrix multiplication work, the dimensions must align. We will use the convention where each **column** is a training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $A$: Shape $(n_{in}, m)$ - where $n_{in}$ is input features,  is number of examples.\n",
    "   * $W$: Shape $(n_{out}, n_{in})$ - where $n_{out}$ is the number of neurons in this layer.\n",
    "   * $b$: Shape $(n_{out}, 1)$ -  Python broadcasting will apply this to all  examples.\n",
    "   * $Z$: Shape $(n_{out}, m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of $W$ as a filter. If the input $A$ matches the pattern in row $i$ of $W$, the resulting dot product will be high. The bias $b$ acts as a threshold; if the weighted sum isn't high enough to overcome a negative bias, the neuron stays \"quiet\" (after activation).\n",
