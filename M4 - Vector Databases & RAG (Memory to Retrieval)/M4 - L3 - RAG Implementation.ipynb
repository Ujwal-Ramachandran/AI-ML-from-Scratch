    "## **Concept 1: The RAG Architecture & Retrieval Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard LLMs are like frozen encyclopedias; they only know what they were trained on up to their cut-off date. If you ask about a private company policy or today's news, they hallucinate or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** solves this by separating **Knowledge** from **Reasoning**.\n",
    "   1. **Retrieval:** You fetch the relevant facts (Knowledge) from your database.\n",
    "   2. **Generation:** You give those facts to the LLM (Reasoning) to formulate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept focuses on the \"R\" (Retrieval). It is essentially a search engine step that happens *before* the LLM is even touched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieval process follows this pipeline:\n",
    "   1. **Query Embedding:** Convert the user's question $Q$ into a vector $V_q$ using an embedding model.\n",
    "   2. **Similarity Search:** Calculate the distance (usually Cosine Similarity) between  and all stored document vectors $V_{d_1}, V_{d_2}, \\dots, V_{d_n}$.\n",
    "   3. **Ranking:** Sort the documents by similarity score (highest to lowest).\n",
    "   4. **Selection:** Select the top $k$ chunks (context) to pass to the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Similarity(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| ||B||}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simpler Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are taking an open-book exam.\n",
    "   1. You read a question (The Query).\n",
    "   2. You don't just guess; you run to the textbook (The Database).\n",
    "   3. You scan the index to find the specific pages that discuss that topic (Retrieval).\n",
    "   4. You keep your finger on those pages (The Context) to read later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs\n",
    "   * **Pros:** The LLM stops guessing and grounds its answers in real data. You can update the data without retraining the model.\n",
    "   * **Cons:** **\"Garbage In, Garbage Out.\"** If your retriever brings back irrelevant documents (e.g., a recipe for cake when you asked about Python classes), the LLM will be confused and give a wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, this retrieval usually happens inside a Vector Database (like ChromaDB, FAISS, or Pinecone) which is optimized to search millions of vectors in milliseconds. For this lesson, we will implement the logic explicitly to ensure you understand the data flow.\n",
    "\n",

    "      * A corpus (a simple Python list of 5-10 distinct sentences/facts).\n",
    "      * Parameter  (number of chunks to retrieve).\n",
    "        \n",
    "   2. **Logic:**\n",

    "      * Embed the **Corpus** (pre-compute these).\n",

    "      * Compute **Cosine Similarity** between the Query Vector and every Corpus Vector.\n",
    "      * Sort and select the top $k$ matches.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   3. **Output:** Return the list of the top $k$ raw text strings.\n",
    "      **Constraints:**\n",
    "      * You may use `sentence_transformers` for embeddings.\n",
    "      * You may use `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity` or `numpy` for the math.\n",
